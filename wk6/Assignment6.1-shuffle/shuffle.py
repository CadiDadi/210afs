# Getting Started

# In your Week 6 folder, create a file called shuffle.py.
# Python provides a built-in method called shuffle for the list data type.  Do not use this.
# For this assignment, you are to create your own shuffle algorithm that will take as input a sorted list and randomly shuffle the items before returning the list.  Try to make your algorithm as efficient as possible.
# Add a comment to your code stating what the time complexity of your algorithm is and why.
# Display list before and after shuffle.  Call your shuffle function multiple times to show the random order of the list items.

# Sample Input:

# [7, 20, 26, 31, 40, 51, 55, 63, 74, 81]

# Sample Output:

#     Before Shuffle:

#     [7, 20, 26, 31, 40, 51, 55, 63, 74, 81]

#     Shuffled:

#     [31, 74, 55, 40, 20, 51, 63, 81, 7, 26]
#     [51, 7, 81, 31, 26, 63, 40, 55, 74, 20]
#     [7, 31, 26, 40, 51, 55, 20, 74, 81, 63]
#     [81, 7, 26, 51, 63, 55, 40, 31, 74, 20]
#     [40, 26, 63, 31, 7, 51, 20, 81, 55, 74]
